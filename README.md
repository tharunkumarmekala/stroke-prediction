Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

üìå Research Project Overview

This research project explores machine learning techniques to predict stroke occurrences based on clinical and demographic parameters. Our model is trained on a dataset containing essential risk factors, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, cholesterol levels, and other key indicators. The study aims to develop a robust, high-accuracy model and deploy it online for public use.

üß™ Methodology

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset

The dataset includes clinical parameters such as Age, BMI, Blood Sugar, Cholesterol, Hypertension, and Atrial Fibrillation.

It has been preprocessed to balance stroke and non-stroke cases to improve model performance.

Feature engineering was applied to enhance predictive capabilities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model

The model utilizes XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.

Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

ROC-AUC Score

Precision-Recall Score

Confusion Matrix Analysis

üöÄ Deployment Instructions

This project is deployed using GitHub and Cloudflare Workers to provide a fast, reliable, and serverless interface for stroke risk prediction.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation & Setup

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.8)

pip

Required Python libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction.git
cd stroke-prediction

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Model Locally

python main.py

This will prompt the user to enter patient details and return the stroke prediction result.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying on Cloudflare Workers

Sign up for Cloudflare Workers: Cloudflare Workers

Install Wrangler CLI (Cloudflare‚Äôs command-line tool):

npm install -g wrangler

Authenticate with Cloudflare:

wrangler login

Initialize the Worker:

wrangler init stroke-prediction-api

Modify wrangler.toml to define the worker settings.

Deploy the model as a Cloudflare Worker API:

wrangler publish

Access the API Endpoint:
Cloudflare provides a URL where the model can be accessed publicly.
